# About me

**My name is Frank Mayer**, I am a **certified IT specialist** for application development.
I am mainly working as a frontend developer. Here I prefer to work with HTML5, Scss and TypeScript. I also have experience at backend with C#, Kotlin and F#.

Besides, I freelance for private clients or work on my projects.

Most of my projects are **open source** available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Frank-Mayer). You can find a selection in my [portfolio](/en/portfolio).

Want to start a project with me? Then just get in touch [here](/en/contact).
