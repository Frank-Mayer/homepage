# Info

**My name is Frank Mayer**. Currently, I'm in an **apprenticeship** to become an IT specialist for application development at LogiSoft-S GmbH. There, I am mainly working as a **frontend developer**.

The main technologies used there are MFC and Xamarin, as well as the tools Figma and Visual Studio.

In addition, I work as a freelancer for privates or do on my own projects. I spend my free time with anime and music.

Most of my projects are available **open source** on [GitHub](https://github.com/Frank-Mayer).
